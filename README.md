##### Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser.

- [Website](https://modernizr.com)
- [Documentation](https://modernizr.com/docs/)
- [Integration tests](https://modernizr.github.io/Modernizr/test/integration.html)
- [Unit tests](https://modernizr.github.io/Modernizr/test/unit.html)

Modernizr tests which native CSS3 and HTML5 features are available in the current UA and makes the results available to you in two ways: as properties on a global `Modernizr` object, and as classes on the `<html>` element. This information allows you to progressively enhance your pages with a granular level of control over the experience.

## New Asynchronous Event Listeners

Often times people want to know when an asynchronous test is done so they can allow their application to react to it.
In the past, you've had to rely on watching properties or `<html>` classes. Only events on **asynchronous** tests are
supported. Synchronous tests should be handled synchronously to improve speed and to maintain consistency.

The new API looks like this:

```js
// Listen to a test, give it a callback
Modernizr.on('testname', function( result ) {
  if (result) {
    console.log('The test passed!');
  }
  else {
    console.log('The test failed!');
  }
});
```

We guarantee that we'll only invoke your function once (per time that you call `on`). We are currently not exposing
a method for exposing the `trigger` functionality. Instead, if you'd like to have control over async tests, use the
`src/addTest` feature, and any test that you set will automatically expose and trigger the `on` functionality.

## Getting Started

- Clone or download the repository
- Install project dependencies with `npm install`

## Building Modernizr 

### From javascript

Modernizr can be used programmatically via npm:

```js
var modernizr = require("modernizr");
```

A `build` method is exposed for generating custom Modernizr builds. Example:

```javascript
var modernizr = require("modernizr");

modernizr.build({}, function (result) {
  console.log(result); // the build
});
```

The first parameter takes a JSON object of options and feature-detects to include. See [`lib/config-all.json`](lib/config-all.json) for all available options.

The second parameter is a function invoked on task completion.

### From the command-line

We also provide a command line interface for building modernizr. 
To see all available options run:

```shell
./bin/modernizr
```

Or to generate everything in 'config-all.json' run this with npm:

```shell
npm start
//outputs to ./dist/modernizr-build.js
```

## Testing Modernizr

To execute the tests using mocha-headless-chrome on the console run:

```shell
npm test
```

You can also run tests in the browser of your choice with this command:

```shell
npm run serve-gh-pages
```

and navigating to these two URLs:

```shell
http://localhost:8080/test/unit.html
http://localhost:8080/test/integration.html
```
