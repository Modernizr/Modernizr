<!-- Please, do NOT post with this template if you are a beginner. Do NOT post with this proposal either if you are searching for a feature to be implemented, use the test request proposal for that -->

Hi ðŸ‘‹!
This issue is intended for new contributors and will help you implement your first changes to the Modernizr project.

**What is proposed**
<!-- Explain the things that are related with the changes the issue requests. If you request new caniuse metadata tags explain how metadata work, the caniuse tag and what it is for -->

**How to do it**
<!-- Explain which files need to be updated, for example in the previous example you would need to explain that the \test\browser\integration\caniuse.js needs to be updated along the tests files. You may link to documentation, to similar PRs or resources that you think that may be helpful. Don't feel afraid of almost doing the PR for them, the idea is to steer them in the right direction so the first contact with the repository is easier (with hopes of bringing more collaborators in :) -->

**Feel free to raise any question in this issue if you stumble with problems and good luck ðŸ’ª!**
