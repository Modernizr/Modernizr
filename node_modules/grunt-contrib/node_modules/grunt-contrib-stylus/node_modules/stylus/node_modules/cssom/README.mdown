# CSSOM

CSSOM.js is a CSS parser written in pure JavaScript. It also a partial implementation of [CSS Object Model](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/). 

    CSSOM.parse("body {color: black}")
    -> {
      cssRules: [
        {
          selectorText: "body",
          style: {
            0: "color",
            color: "black",
            length: 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }


## [Parser demo](http://nv.github.com/CSSOM/docs/parse.html)

Works well in Google Chrome 6+, Safari 5+, Firefox 3.6+, Opera 10.63+.
Doesn't work in IE < 9 because of unsupported getters/setters.

To use CSSOM.js in the browser you might want to build a one-file version with [Jake](http://github.com/mde/node-jake):

    âž¤ jake
    build/CSSOM.js is done

To use it with Node.js:

    npm install cssom
