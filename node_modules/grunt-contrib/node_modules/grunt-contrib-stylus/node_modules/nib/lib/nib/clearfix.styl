/*
 * The Magnificent Micro Clearfix
 *
 * Useful for clearing floats without structural markup.
 * Prevents margin-collapsing on child elements in most cases.
 *
 * Known issues:
 *
 * 1. For IE 6/7 when applied to an element that contains only left-floated
 *    children the bottom margin on child elements will be collapsed.
 *
 * 2. For Firefox versions prior to 3.5 when applied to the first child element
 *    of body, and the element does not have non-zero padding, extra space will
 *    appear between the body and the first child.
