    /**
    A string which represents the root or collection part of the URL which
    relates to a Model or ModelList. Usually this value should be same for all
    instances of a specific Model/ModelList subclass.

    When sub-classing `Y.Model`, usually you'll only need to override this
    property, which lets the URLs for the XHRs be generated by convention. If
    the `root` string ends with a trailing-slash, XHR URLs will also end with a
    "/", and if the `root` does not end with a slash, neither will the XHR URLs.

    @example
        Y.User = Y.Base.create('user', Y.Model, [Y.ModelSync.REST], {
            root: '/users'
        });

        var currentUser, newUser;

        // GET the user data from: "/users/123"
        currentUser = new Y.User({id: '123'}).load();

        // POST the new user data to: "/users"
        newUser = new Y.User({name: 'Eric Ferraiuolo'}).save();

    When sub-classing `Y.ModelList`, usually you'll want to ignore configuring
    the `root` and simply rely on the build-in convention of the list's
    generated URLs defaulting to the `root` specified by the list's `model`.

    @property root
    @type String
    @default ""
    @since 3.6.0
    **/
    root: '',

    /**
    A string which specifies the URL to use when making XHRs, if not value is
    provided, the URLs used to make XHRs will be generated by convention.

    While a `url` can be provided for each Model/ModelList instance, usually
    you'll want to either rely on the default convention or provide a tokenized
    string on the prototype which can be used for all instances.

    When sub-classing `Y.Model`, you will probably be able to rely on the
    default convention of generating URLs in conjunction with the `root`
    property and whether the model is new or not (i.e. has an `id`). If the
    `root` property ends with a trailing-slash, the generated URL for the
    specific model will also end with a trailing-slash.

    @example
        Y.User = Y.Base.create('user', Y.Model, [Y.ModelSync.REST], {
            root: '/users/'
        });

        var currentUser, newUser;

        // GET the user data from: "/users/123/"
        currentUser = new Y.User({id: '123'}).load();

        // POST the new user data to: "/users/"
        newUser = new Y.User({name: 'Eric Ferraiuolo'}).save();

    If a `url` is specified, it will be processed by `Y.Lang.sub()`, which is
    useful when the URLs for a Model/ModelList subclass match a specific pattern
    and can use simple replacement tokens; e.g.:

    @example
        Y.User = Y.Base.create('user', Y.Model, [Y.ModelSync.REST], {
            root: '/users',
            url : '/users/{username}'
        });

    **Note:** String subsitituion of the `url` only use string an number values
    provided by this object's attribute and/or the `options` passed to the
    `getURL()` method. Do not expect something fancy to happen with Object,
    Array, or Boolean values, they will simply be ignored.

    If your URLs have plural roots or collection URLs, while the specific item
    resources are under a singular name, e.g. "/users" (plural) and "/user/123"
    (singular), you'll probably want to configure the `root` and `url`
    properties like this:

    @example
        Y.User = Y.Base.create('user', Y.Model, [Y.ModelSync.REST], {
            root: '/users',
            url : '/user/{id}'
        });

        var currentUser, newUser;

        // GET the user data from: "/user/123"
        currentUser = new Y.User({id: '123'}).load();

        // POST the new user data to: "/users"
        newUser = new Y.User({name: 'Eric Ferraiuolo'}).save();

    When sub-classing `Y.ModelList`, usually you'll be able to rely on the
    associated `model` to supply its `root` to be used as the model list's URL.
    If this needs to be customized, you can provide a simple string for the
    `url` property.

    @example
        Y.Users = Y.Base.create('users', Y.ModelList, [Y.ModelSync.REST], {
            // Leverages `Y.User`'s `root`, which is "/users".
            model: Y.User
        });

        // Or specified explicitly...

        Y.Users = Y.Base.create('users', Y.ModelList, [Y.ModelSync.REST], {
            model: Y.User,
            url  : '/users'
        });
