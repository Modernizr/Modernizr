/**
Represents a logical piece of an application's user interface, and provides a
lightweight, overridable API for rendering content and handling delegated DOM
events on a container element.

The View class imposes little structure and provides only minimal functionality
of its own: it's basically just an overridable API interface that helps you
implement custom views.

As of YUI 3.5.0, View allows ad-hoc attributes to be specified at instantiation
time, so you don't need to subclass `Y.View` to add custom attributes. Just pass
them to the constructor:

    var view = new Y.View({foo: 'bar'});
    view.get('foo'); // => "bar"

@class View
@constructor
@extends Base
@since 3.4.0
**/

function View() {
    View.superclass.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
}

Y.View = Y.extend(View, Y.Base, {

    containerTemplate: '<div/>',

    /**
    Hash of CSS selectors mapped to events to delegate to elements matching
    those selectors.

    CSS selectors are relative to the `container` element. Events are attached
    to the container, and delegation is used so that subscribers are only
    notified of events that occur on elements inside the container that match
    the specified selectors. This allows the container's contents to be re-
    rendered as needed without losing event subscriptions.

    Event handlers can be specified either as functions or as strings that map
    to function names on this view instance or its prototype.

    The `this` object in event handlers will refer to this view instance. If
    you'd prefer `this` to be something else, use `Y.bind()` to bind a custom
    `this` object.

    @example

        var view = new Y.View({
            events: {
                // Call `this.toggle()` whenever the element with the id
                // "toggle-button" is clicked.
                '#toggle-button': {click: 'toggle'},

                // Call `this.hoverOn()` when the mouse moves over any element
                // with the "hoverable" class, and `this.hoverOff()` when the
                // mouse moves out of any element with the "hoverable" class.
                '.hoverable': {
                    mouseover: 'hoverOn',
                    mouseout : 'hoverOff'
                }

        Container node into which this view's content will be rendered.

        The container node serves as the host for all DOM events attached by the
        view. Delegation is used to handle events on children of the container,
        allowing the container's contents to be re-rendered at any time without
        losing event subscriptions.

        The default container is a `<div>` Node, but you can override this in
        a subclass, or by passing in a custom `container` config value at
        instantiation time. If you override the default container in a subclass
        using `ATTRS`, you must use the `valueFn` property. The view's constructor
        will ignore any assignments using `value`.

        When `container` is overridden by a subclass or passed as a config
        option at instantiation time, you can provide it as a selector string, a
        DOM element, a `Y.Node` instance, or (if you are subclassing and modifying
        the attribute), a `valueFn` function that returns a `Y.Node` instance.
        The value will be converted into a `Y.Node` instance if it isn't one
        already.

        The container is not added to the page automatically. This allows you to
        have full control over how and when your view is actually rendered to
        the page.
