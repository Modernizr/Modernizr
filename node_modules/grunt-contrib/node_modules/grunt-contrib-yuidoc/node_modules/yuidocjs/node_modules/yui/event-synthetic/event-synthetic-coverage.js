/**
 * <p>Defines a new event in the DOM event system.  Implementers are
 * responsible for monitoring for a scenario whereby the event is fired.  A
 * notifier object is provided to the functions identified below.  When the
 * criteria defining the event are met, call notifier.fire( [args] ); to
 * execute event subscribers.</p>
 *
 * <p>The first parameter is the name of the event.  The second parameter is a
 * configuration object which define the behavior of the event system when the
 * new event is subscribed to or detached from.  The methods that should be
 * defined in this configuration object are <code>on</code>,
 * <code>detach</code>, <code>delegate</code>, and <code>detachDelegate</code>.
 * You are free to define any other methods or properties needed to define your
 * event.  Be aware, however, that since the object is used to subclass
 * SyntheticEvent, you should avoid method names used by SyntheticEvent unless
 * your intention is to override the default behavior.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is a list of properties and methods that you can or should specify
 * in the configuration object:</p>
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><code>on</code></dt>
 *       <dd><code>function (node, subscription, notifier)</code> The
 *       implementation logic for subscription.  Any special setup you need to
 *       do to create the environment for the event being fired--E.g. native
 *       DOM event subscriptions.  Store subscription related objects and
 *       state on the <code>subscription</code> object.  When the
 *       criteria have been met to fire the synthetic event, call
 *       <code>notifier.fire(e)</code>.  See Notifier's <code>fire()</code>
 *       method for details about what to pass as parameters.</dd>
 *
 *   <dt><code>detach</code></dt>
 *       <dd><code>function (node, subscription, notifier)</code> The
 *       implementation logic for cleaning up a detached subscription. E.g.
 *       detach any DOM subscriptions added in <code>on</code>.</dd>
 *
 *   <dt><code>delegate</code></dt>
 *       <dd><code>function (node, subscription, notifier, filter)</code> The
 *       implementation logic for subscription via <code>Y.delegate</code> or
 *       <code>node.delegate</code>.  The filter is typically either a selector
 *       string or a function.  You can use
 *       <code>Y.delegate.compileFilter(selectorString)</code> to create a
 *       filter function from a selector string if needed.  The filter function
 *       expects an event object as input and should output either null, a
 *       matching Node, or an array of matching Nodes.  Otherwise, this acts
 *       like <code>on</code> DOM event subscriptions.  Store subscription
 *       related objects and information on the <code>subscription</code>
 *       object.  When the criteria have been met to fire the synthetic event,
 *       call <code>notifier.fire(e)</code> as noted above.</dd>
 *
 *   <dt><code>detachDelegate</code></dt>
 *       <dd><code>function (node, subscription, notifier)</code> The
 *       implementation logic for cleaning up a detached delegate subscription.
 *       E.g. detach any DOM delegate subscriptions added in
 *       <code>delegate</code>.</dd>
 *
 *   <dt><code>publishConfig</code></dt>
 *       <dd>(Object) The configuration object that will be used to instantiate
 *       the underlying CustomEvent. See Notifier's <code>fire</code> method
 *       for details.</dd>
 *
 *   <dt><code>processArgs</code></dt
 *       <dd>
 *          <p><code>function (argArray, fromDelegate)</code> Optional method
 *          to extract any additional arguments from the subscription
 *          signature.  Using this allows <code>on</code> or
 *          <code>delegate</code> signatures like
 *          <code>node.on(&quot;hover&quot;, overCallback,
 *          outCallback)</code>.</p>
 *          <p>When processing an atypical argument signature, make sure the
 *          args array is returned to the normal signature before returning
 *          from the function.  For example, in the &quot;hover&quot; example
 *          above, the <code>outCallback</code> needs to be <code>splice</code>d
 *          out of the array.  The expected signature of the args array for
 *          <code>on()</code> subscriptions is:</p>
 *          <pre>
 *              <code>[type, callback, target, contextOverride, argN...]</code>
 *          </pre>
 *          <p>And for <code>delegate()</code>:</p>
 *          <pre>
 *              <code>[type, callback, target, filter, contextOverride, argN...]</code>
 *          </pre>
 *          <p>where <code>target</code> is the node the event is being
 *          subscribed for.  You can see these signatures documented for
 *          <code>Y.on()</code> and <code>Y.delegate()</code> respectively.</p>
 *          <p>Whatever gets returned from the function will be stored on the
 *          <code>subscription</code> object under
 *          <code>subscription._extra</code>.</p></dd>
 *   <dt><code>subMatch</code></dt>
 *       <dd>
 *           <p><code>function (sub, args)</code>  Compares a set of
 *           subscription arguments against a Subscription object to determine
 *           if they match.  The default implementation compares the callback
