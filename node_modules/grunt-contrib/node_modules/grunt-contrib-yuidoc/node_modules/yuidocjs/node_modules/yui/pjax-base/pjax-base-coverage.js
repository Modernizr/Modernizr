    Non-HTML5 browsers will navigate to the new URL via manipulation of
    `window.location`.

    When there is a route handler for the specified URL and it is being
    navigated to, this method will return `true`, otherwise it will return
    `false`.

    **Note:** The specified URL _must_ be of the same origin as the current URL,
    otherwise an error will be logged and navigation will not occur. This is
    intended as both a security constraint and a purposely imposed limitation as
    it does not make sense to tell the router to navigate to a URL on a
    different scheme, host, or port.

    @method navigate
    @param {String} url The URL to navigate to. This must be of the same origin
      as the current URL.
    @param {Object} [options] Additional options to configure the navigation.
      These are mixed into the `navigate` event facade.
        @param {Boolean} [options.replace] Whether or not the current history
          entry will be replaced, or a new entry will be created. Will default
          to `true` if the specified `url` is the same as the current URL.
        @param {Boolean} [options.force=false] Whether the enhanced navigation
          should occur even in browsers without HTML5 history.
    @return {Boolean} `true` if the URL was navigated to, `false` otherwise.
