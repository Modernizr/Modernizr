/**
Extension that provides core autocomplete logic (but no UI implementation) for a
text input field or textarea.

The `AutoCompleteBase` class provides events and attributes that abstract away
core autocomplete logic and configuration, but does not provide a widget
implementation or suggestion UI. For a prepackaged autocomplete widget, see
`AutoCompleteList`.

This extension cannot be instantiated directly, since it doesn't provide an
actual implementation. It's intended to be mixed into a `Y.Base`-based class or
widget.

`Y.Widget`-based example:

    YUI().use('autocomplete-base', 'widget', function (Y) {
        var MyAC = Y.Base.create('myAC', Y.Widget, [Y.AutoCompleteBase], {
            // Custom prototype methods and properties.
        }, {
            // Custom static methods and properties.
        });

        // Custom implementation code.
    });

`Y.Base`-based example:

    YUI().use('autocomplete-base', function (Y) {
        var MyAC = Y.Base.create('myAC', Y.Base, [Y.AutoCompleteBase], {
            initializer: function () {
                this._bindUIACBase();
                this._syncUIACBase();
            },

            // Custom prototype methods and properties.
        }, {
            // Custom static methods and properties.
        });

        A function source will be called with the current query and a

        or 'value', depending on what you want to use as the text of the
        result.

        Each result will be an object with the following properties:

        with an internally-generated JSONP callback name. Both placeholders must
        appear in the URL, or the request will fail. An optional `{maxResults}`
        placeholder may also be provided, and will be replaced with the value of

        may also be provided, and will be replaced with the value of the
        maxResults attribute (or 1000 if the maxResults attribute is 0 or less).
        </p>

        <p>
        The response is assumed to be a JSON array of results by default. If the
        response is a JSON object and not an array, provide a

        `{query}` placeholder will be replaced with the current autocomplete
        query. This placeholder must appear in the YQL query, or the request
        will fail. An optional `{maxResults}` placeholder may also be provided,
        and will be replaced with the value of the maxResults attribute (or 1000
        if the maxResults attribute is 0 or less).
        </p>

        <strong>The `yql` module must be loaded in order for YQL
