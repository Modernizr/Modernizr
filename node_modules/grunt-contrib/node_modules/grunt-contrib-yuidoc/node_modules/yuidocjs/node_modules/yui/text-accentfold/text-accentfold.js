/**
 * <p>
 * Provides a basic accent folding implementation that converts common accented
 * letters (like "á") to their non-accented forms (like "a").
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation is not comprehensive, and should only be used as a last
 * resort when accent folding can't be done on the server. A comprehensive
 * accent folding implementation would require much more character data to be
 * sent to the browser, resulting in a significant performance penalty. This
 * implementation strives for a compromise between usefulness and performance.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Accent folding is a destructive operation that can't be reversed, and may
 * change or destroy the actual meaning of the text depending on the language.
 * It should not be used on strings that will later be displayed to a user,
 * unless this is done with the understanding that linguistic meaning may be
 * lost and that you may in fact confuse or insult the user by doing so.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When used for matching, accent folding is likely to produce erroneous matches
 * for languages in which characters with diacritics are considered different
 * from their base characters, or where correct folding would map to other
 * character sequences than just stripped characters. For example, in German
 * "ü" is a character that's clearly different from "u" and should match "ue"
 * instead. The word "betrügen" means "to defraud", while "betrugen" is the past
 * tense of "to behave". The name "Müller" is expected to match "Mueller", but
 * not "Muller". On the other hand, accent folding falls short for languages
 * where different base characters are expected to match. In Japanese, for
 * example, hiragana and katakana characters with the same pronunciation ("あ"
 * and "ア") are commonly treated as equivalent for lookups, but accent folding
 * treats them as different.
