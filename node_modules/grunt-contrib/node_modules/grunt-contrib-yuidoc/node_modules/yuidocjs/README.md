YUIDoc Doc parser
=================

YUIDoc is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) application used at build time to 
generate API documentation for JavaScript code. YUIDoc is comment-driven and supports a wide 
range of JavaScript coding styles. The output of YUI Doc is API documentation formatted as a 
set of HTML pages including information about methods, properties, custom events and 
inheritance for JavaScript objects. YUIDoc was orignally written for the YUI Project;
it uses YUI JavaScript and CSS in the generated files and it supports common YUI 
conventions like Custom Events. That said, it can be used easily and productively on non-YUI code.
