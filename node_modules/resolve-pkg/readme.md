# resolve-pkg [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-pkg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-pkg)

> Resolve the path of a package regardless of it having an entry

Some packages like CLI tools and grunt tasks don't have a entry point, like `"main": "foo.js"` in package.json, resulting in them not being resolvable by `require.resolve()`. Unlike `require.resolve()`, this module also resolves packages without an entry point, returns `null` instead of throwing when the module can't be found, and resolves from `process.cwd()` instead `__dirname` by default.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save resolve-pkg
```


## Usage

```js
const resolvePkg = require('resolve-pkg');

// $ npm install --save-dev grunt-svgmin

resolvePkg('grunt-svgmin/tasks', {cwd: __dirname});
//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn/node_modules/grunt-svgmin/tasks'

// fails here as grunt tasks usually don't have a defined main entry point
require.resolve('grunt-svgmin/tasks');
//=> Error: Cannot find module 'grunt-svgmin'
```


## API

#### moduleId

Type: `string`

What you would use in `require()`.

#### options

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `process.cwd()`
