(or \"present working directory\") If this does not yield a `.jshintrc` file, it will move one level up (`..`) the directory tree all the way up to the filesystem root. If a file is found, it stops immediately and uses that set of configuration.\n\nThis setup allows you to set up **one** configuration file for your entire project. (place it in the root folder) As long as you run `jshint` from anywhere within your project directory tree, the same configuration file will be used.\n\n### Home Directory\n\nIf all the methods above do not yield a `.jshintrc` to use, the last place that will be checked is your user's `$HOME` directory.\n\n## File Extensions\n\nDefault extension for files is \".js\". If you want to use JSHint with other file extensions (.json), you need to pass this extra extension as an option :\n\n    --extra-ext .json\n\n## Ignoring Files and Directories\n\nIf there is a .jshintignore file in your project's directory tree, (also provided you run `jshint` from within your project's directory) then any directories or files specified will be skipped over. (behaves just like a `.gitignore` file)\n\n**Note:** Pattern matching uses minimatch, with the nocase [option](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch). When there is no match, it performs a left side match (when no forward slashes present and path is a directory).\n\n## Installing dependencies for development\n\n    ./configure\n\n## Build Commands\n\n    jake -T\n\n## Project Guidelines\n\n* All tests are passing.\n* No (new) JSHint errors are introduced.\n",
