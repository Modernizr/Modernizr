## Project Creation Transcript

\"init:$template\" template, this session transcript was added afterwards. The
text after the `$` are the commands that were executed, and everything else is
program output.

Note that this entire build process is automated by a rather complex \[expect

creation of this and other \[init task\]\[init\] sample repositories.
