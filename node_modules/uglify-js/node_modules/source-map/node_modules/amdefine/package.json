  "readme": "# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD's define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"amdefine\": \">=0.0.2\"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== 'function') { var define = require('amdefine')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don't have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Version 0.0.2](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/0.0.2/amdefine.js)\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require('dependency');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine(['dependency'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name=\"optimizer\"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== 'function')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== 'function') { var define = require('amdefine')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node's synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD's callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require(['a'], function(a) {\n        //'a' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API's `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT.
