/*
 * Modernizr tests which native CSS3 and HTML5 features are available in the
 * current UA and makes the results available to you in two ways: as properties on
 * a global `Modernizr` object, and as classes on the `<html>` element. This
 * information allows you to progressively enhance your pages with a granular level
 * of control over the experience.
 *
 * Modernizr has an optional (*not included*) conditional resource loader called
 * `Modernizr.load()`, based on [Yepnope.js](http://yepnopejs.com). You can get a
 * build that includes `Modernizr.load()`, as well as choosing which feature tests
 * to include on the [Download page](http://www.modernizr.com/download/).
